Project description and objectives:
This project implements a Simple  Shopping Cart System using Java and  follows Object Oriented Programming  principles with several major Software  Design Patterns. The purpose of the  system is to demonstrate how design  patterns can improve code  organization, reduce complexity, and  increase extensibility.

The system allows the user to:
View a product catalog
Add products to the cart
Remove items from the cart
Use gift wrapping (decorator)
Select payment methods (strategy)
Process checkout through commands
Automatically notify observers (inventory + email)
This project is fully implemented using standard Java, supports console-based interaction, 
and demonstrates practical usage of multiple design patterns in one system.
System Overview

The system consists of:
Catalog – Stores available products.
Product & Decorators – Items that can be wrapped using the Decorator pattern.
ShoppingCart – Stores selected items using Singleton to ensure only one cart exists.
Commands – Add, Remove, and Checkout commands encapsulating user operations.


Payment Strategies – Credit card or PayPal payment.
Observers – Receive notifications after checkout (inventory + email).
ShopService – Handles checkout logic and triggers observers
